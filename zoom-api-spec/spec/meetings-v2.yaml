        * The user calling this API must be the host or an alternative meeting
        host.

        * A meeting's `start_url` value is the URL a host or an alternative host

        * For `custCreate` meeting hosts (users created with the `custCreate`
        parameter via the [**Create

        **Note:**


        For security reasons, the recommended way to programmatically get the
        updated `start_url` value after expiry is to call the [**Get a

        to the `start_url` value in the response.
